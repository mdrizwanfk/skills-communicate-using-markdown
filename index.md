## Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind

One thousand years have passed since the Seven Days of Fire, an apocalyptic war that destroyed civilization and caused an ecocide, creating the vast Toxic Jungle,[a] a poisonous forest swarming with giant mutant insects.[4] In the kingdom of the Valley of the Wind, a prophecy predicts a savior "clothed in a blue robe, descending onto a golden field". The Valley's princess Nausicaä explores the jungle and communicates with its creatures, including the gigantic, trilobite-like armored Ohm.[b] She hopes to understand the jungle and find a way for it and humans to coexist.
